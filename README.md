This repo holds an excercise in test-driving Conways game of life quickly, in one day. Here is [an explanation of the game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). The rules are:

+ Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
+ Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
+ Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by over-population.
+ Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.  


Thanks for checking it out!
